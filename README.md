# WriteWinged API

A collaborative writing platform backend

## What is WriteWinged?

WriteWinged reimagines creative writing as a dynamic, version-controlled experience. Similar to how development teams build software together, WriteWinged empowers writers to build stories collaboratively—with full version history, collaborative suggestions, and transparent ownership across contributions.
Whether you're a solo author tracking your creative iterations or a community building worlds together, WriteWinged provides the infrastructure for stories to grow, adapt, and improve through meaningful collaboration
